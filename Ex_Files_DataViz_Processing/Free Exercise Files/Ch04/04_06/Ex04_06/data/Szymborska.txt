"A Contribution to Statistics"

Out of a hundred people…


those who always know better:

fifty-two


doubting every step:

nearly all the rest


glad to lend a hand

if it doesn’t take too long:

as high as forty-nine


always good

because they can’t be otherwise:

four, well maybe five


able to admire without envy:

eighteen


suffering illusions

induced by fleeting youth:

sixty, give or take a few


not to be taken lightly:

forty and four


living in constant fear

of someone or something:

seventy-seven


capable of happiness:

twenty-something tops


harmless singly, savage in crowds:

half at least


cruel

when forced by circumstances:

better not to know

even ballpark figures


wise after the fact:

just a couple more

than wise before it


taking only things from life:

thirty

(I wish I were wrong)


hunched in pain

no flashlight in the dark:

eighty-three

sooner or later


righteous:

thirty-five, which is a lot


righteous

and understanding:

three


worthy of compassion:

ninety-nine


mortal:

a hundred out of a hundred.


thus far this figure still remains unchanged.
